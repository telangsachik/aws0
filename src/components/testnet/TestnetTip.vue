        CheCko is run with Linera DevNet currently. Token symbol
        <strong>TLINERA</strong> used in CheCko is only a placeholder to show
        the functionalities of Linera wallet work-flows. CheCko won"t DM
        anyone to get money for any reason. And, CheCko is only a third-party
        open source wallet solution for Linera devloped by consecutive Linera
        hackathon winner <a href='https://respeer.ai'>ResPeer</a>'s
        <strong>Microchain as a Service</strong> architecture. Community
        members should not think of CheCko is official Linera wallet. Official
        team will release browser wallet which integrates microchain to
        browser extension soon.
